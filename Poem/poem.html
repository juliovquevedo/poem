        <h2>The Arrow and the Song</h2>
        <p>
            I shot an arrow into the air,<br/>
            It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br/>
            For, so swiftly if flew, the sight<br/>
            Could not follow it in its flight.
        </p>
        <p>
            I breathed a song into the air,<br/>
            It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br/>
            For who has sight so keen and strong,<br/>
            That it can follow the flight of a song?
        </p>
        <p>
            Long, long afterward, in an oak<br/>
            I found the arrow, still unbroke;<br/>
            And the song, from beginning to end,<br/>
            I found again in the heart of a fried.
