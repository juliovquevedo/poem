        <h1>The Arrow and the Song</h1>
        <div>
        <p>
            <span class="line1">I shot an arrow into the air,</span><br/>
            <span class="line2">It fell to earth, I knew not where;</span><br/>
            <span class="line3">For, so swiftly if flew, the sight</span><br/>
            <span class="line4">Could not follow it in its flight.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="line5">I breathed a song into the air,</span><br/>
            <span class="line6">It fell to earth, I knew not where;</span><br/>
            <span class="line7">For who has sight so keen and strong,</span><br/>
            <span class="line8">That it can follow the flight of a song?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="line9">Long, long afterward, in an oak</span><br/>
            <span class="line10">I found the arrow, still unbroke;</span><br/>
            <span class="line11">And the song, from beginning to end,</span><br/>
            <span class="line12">I found again in the heart of a friend.</span>
        </p>
        </div>
